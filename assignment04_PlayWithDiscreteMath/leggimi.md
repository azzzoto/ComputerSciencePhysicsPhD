I ≈ h * (f(x₀)/2 + f(x₁) + f(x₂) + ... + f(xₙ₋₁) + f(xₙ)/2)

Here’s how you can answer those questions in English:

**2) How can you reduce the relative error?**  
To reduce the relative error, the following techniques can be applied:  

- **Increase the number of sampling points \( N \)**: A higher \( N \) leads to a smaller step size \( h \), improving the accuracy of the trapezoidal rule.  
- **Use a higher-order numerical integration method**: Instead of the trapezoidal rule, applying the **Simpson's rule** or **Gauss-Legendre quadrature** can provide better accuracy for the same number of points.  
- **Refine the integration domain adaptively**: Using an adaptive quadrature method, such as GSL’s `gsl_integration_qag`, can improve accuracy by concentrating evaluations where the function varies the most.  
- **Increase the precision of floating-point operations**: Using `long double` instead of `double` can help minimize floating-point errors, though the improvement may be marginal.  
- **Improve function evaluation accuracy**: If the function contains terms that could lead to numerical instability, reformulating the function or using series expansions in certain ranges might help.

**3) Which is the minimum relative error you can find using the techniques you described in point 2?**  
The minimum relative error depends on the chosen technique:  

- **By increasing \( N \) significantly**: The relative error of the trapezoidal rule can be reduced to around **\( 10^{-6} \) to \( 10^{-8} \)**, but diminishing returns occur beyond a certain \( N \).  
- **Using a higher-order method (e.g., Simpson’s rule)**: The error can be reduced to **\( 10^{-10} \) or lower** with fewer evaluations than the trapezoidal rule.  
- **Using GSL's adaptive quadrature (`gsl_integration_qag`)**: The relative error can be reduced to **\( 10^{-12} \) or lower**, as GSL dynamically refines the step size for optimal accuracy.  
- **Using extended precision arithmetic (long double or arbitrary precision libraries like MPFR)**: The error could theoretically be pushed below **\( 10^{-15} \)**, but this depends on the implementation's numerical precision limits.  

In conclusion, the best trade-off between computation time and accuracy is likely achieved using **adaptive quadrature with GSL (`gsl_integration_qag`)**, which can yield relative errors below **\( 10^{-12} \)** efficiently.
