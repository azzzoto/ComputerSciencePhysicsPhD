# Task description

## Step 1
In this follow-up task we're asked to choose between: 
1. One compiled language among:
    * C
    * C++
    * Fortran

2. and one interpreted Languages among:
    * Python
    * Julia
    * Mathematica
    * Matlab

> I will chose **C** and **Julia** since are two programming languages I've never coded with.

## Step 2
After choosing a compiled and an interpreted language now is the problem you want to solve:

Given the following input:
```
a = 3 -> a real-valued scalar number
```
and 
```
x = (1,1,1,1,1, …, 1 ) -> a real-valued vector of dimension N = 20

y = (4,4,4,4,4, …, 4 ) -> a real-valued vector of dimension N = 20
```

write a computer program that calculates the following scalar product: `z = a*x + y` and print its value on a text file.
